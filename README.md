# Diabetes-Database-Model
This project displays a database built for diabetes dataset from its logical model to it's visualization and will also include SQL queries used for data exploration. 



<h2>Description</h2>
I felt it was import to demonstrate a project beyond queries in order to display all that goes into creating a database. I will also include the logical data model complete with tables, their relationships, and their primary keys. Next ill play around with a few queries to discover more information about the dataset to see what story(s) it tells. "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes,based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Secondly, From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent
(several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome)"
